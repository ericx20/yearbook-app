Has the pandemic prevented you from getting your yearbook signed by your friends?
This web app lets you make a virtual yearbook page that everyone can sign!

Try out the live demo [here!](https://ericx20.github.io/assets/yearbook-app-demo/index.html)
Please note: right now the drawing capabilities are fully functional, however the sharing feature is still being implemented on the client side. Check out the [backend](https://github.com/ericx20/yearbook-server) of this project which has a REST API for saving and sharing yearbooks!

Features:

- Customizable brush for signing and drawing
- Powerful undo/redo on the canvas
- To be implemented: Shareable yearbook codes
